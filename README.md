Simple Real - Time weather forecast
## Weather App - Simple Forecast 

This is a basic weather application that retrieves the current weather data and displays it along with a high-level forecast for the upcoming few days.

**Features:**

- Shows current weather information (temperature, description, icon) for a searched city.
- Displays a simple text-based forecast for the today.

**Requirements:**

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript knowledge
- An API key for a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) - optional (for current weather data)
- An additional data source for the high-level forecast (text-based weather service, etc.) - optional

**Setup:**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. If you plan to use a weather API for current weather data, obtain an API key from the chosen service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and replace the placeholder in the code.
3. Consider adding a text-based weather service API or another data source to retrieve the high-level forecast for the upcoming days.

**Usage:**

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a city name in the search bar and press Enter or click the search button.
3. The app will display the current weather information for the entered city and a text-based forecast for the upcoming days (if implemented).

**Note:**

This is a basic example. You can customize it further to improve the user interface, add features, or use different data sources for weather information.

**Further Exploration:**

- Explore using a weather API that provides built-in forecast data to eliminate the need for an additional data source. (e.g., AccuWeather, WeatherAPI)
